        <para id="id1171928708808">The information you gave about the enterprise that you have chosen shows that the following points are always applicable to a business and should be taken into account when considering a business idea:</para>
        <para id="id1171919785132">A specific product (or collection of products) or service must be offered.</para>
        <para id="id1171932964236">The manufacturing or sourcing of the product(s), or provision of the service, must be sustained.</para>

        <para id="id1171926495335">The actions taken by an entrepreneur can be divided into different groups. The following is a broad division within which further subdivisions can be made:</para>
        <para id="id1171920562442">Something that already exists and is readily available and plentiful can be used for something else (<emphasis effect="italics">new purpose</emphasis>). For example: Someone decided to buy the pieces of broken brick that cannot be used in masonry on a building site and used it for paving at a price which no other paving businesses could match. It was a great success.</para>
        <para id="id1171928599662">Something that already exists can be altered by way of an improvement (<emphasis effect="italics">improvement</emphasis>). The development of the microchip in computer technology is a good example. Another example is the reduction in size of huge computers that filled a whole room, to personal computers (desktops) and later to laptops. A totally different example is where a shop owner decides to diversify by expanding his range of products. He improves upon his existing service.</para>
        <para id="id1171932933229">Something new can be developed that altogether replaces something that is available on the market (<emphasis effect="italics">substitution</emphasis>). At present plastic lenses for spectacles are replacing the older type of glass lenses.</para>
